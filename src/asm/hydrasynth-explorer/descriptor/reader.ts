/**
 * Hydrasynth Explorer DeviceDescriptor — DeviceReader implementation.
 *
 * Scope (v1 scaffold, BK-031): MINIMAL. The Hydrasynth has no decoded
 * single-param READ primitive in our current tooling — the existing
 * `hydra_*` tool surface is write-heavy by design (the only read tool
 * is `hydra_get_active_patch`, which surfaces an inbound CC observation
 * rather than issuing a query/response round-trip).
 *
 * Reader contract requires `getParam` + `getParams`. We satisfy the
 * type system but throw `capability_not_supported` at runtime — the
 * dispatcher returns that cleanly to the agent, who can fall back to
 * audible/visible verification on the device front panel.
 *
 * `scanLocations` and `lookupLineage` are optional and omitted. The
 * Hydrasynth has no Fractal-style preset-scan envelope (each patch is
 * a full ~13KB SysEx dump, not a single-byte name read), and no
 * Fractal-authored lineage corpus.
