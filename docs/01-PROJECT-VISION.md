# MCP MIDI Control — Project Vision

## One-Line Pitch
Talk to Claude, get authentic tones instantly loaded onto your USB MIDI gear —
Fractal AM4, Axe-Fx II XL+, Axe-Fx III (community beta), ASM Hydrasynth
Explorer, plus any device reachable over generic MIDI.

## The Problem
Building presets on a hardware amp modeler or synth requires deep technical
knowledge of parameter names, signal chains, and effect types. Even experienced
players spend hours dialing in a tone that could be described in one sentence.
Sharing presets across players is fragmented and format-locked.

## The Solution
A local MCP server that bridges Claude Desktop and the user's hardware over
USB/MIDI. The user describes what they want in plain language. Claude
translates that into precise SysEx / CC / NRPN commands and sends them
directly to the device — no vendor editor required. AM4 is the headline
device (deepest RE, hardware-verified end-to-end); additional Fractal and
ASM devices ship in the same release.

## Core User Experience

```
User: "Give me a preset for Amber by 311 — 4 scenes, verse through solo"

Claude: Researches Tim Mahoney's verified gear for that recording era,
        maps each block to AM4 equivalents, builds 4 scenes, confirms
        target slots are safe to write, sends to device.

Device: Preset appears on AM4. User plays it immediately.

User: "The filter is too quacky on the verse"

Claude: Reduces Filter sensitivity, re-sends, asks how it sounds now.
```

## Target User
- Musicians who own at least one supported USB MIDI device (Fractal AM4 is
  the headline; Axe-Fx II XL+, Axe-Fx III, Hydrasynth Explorer also supported;
  any MIDI device works through generic-MIDI primitives).
- Comfortable with Claude Desktop (free tier acceptable)
- Want authentic tones without deep technical knowledge
- Perform live and need organized preset libraries

## What It Is Not
- Not a visual preset editor (vendor-editor replacement)
- Not cloud-hosted — runs entirely local
- Not a subscription service
- Not closed-source. Apache-2.0 from v0.1.0.

---

## Success Criteria (v0.1.0)
1. Can send a complete preset to AM4 without AM4-Edit open (✅ shipping)
2. Claude can describe a famous tone and produce a working preset (✅ shipping)
3. Iterative refinement loop works ("more gain", "darker reverb") (✅ shipping)
4. Preset slots are never silently overwritten — save-authorization gate
   enforced uniformly across devices (✅ shipping; see
   [`docs/SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md`](SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md))
5. Same UX works across multiple devices via the unified 17-tool surface
   (✅ shipping: AM4, Axe-Fx II XL+, Hydrasynth Explorer; Axe-Fx III in
   community beta)

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js / TypeScript
- **MCP Framework:** @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
- **MIDI/USB:** node-midi (npm)
- **Protocol:** Fractal Audio SysEx over USB-MIDI
- **AI:** Claude Desktop (claude.ai) via MCP connector
- **Future AI:** Claude API (anthropic SDK) for standalone mode

## Phased Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Feasibility (complete, 2026-04-14)
Proved USB/MIDI SysEx round-trip with AM4 without AM4-Edit. Session 02
confirmed AM4 follows the Axe-Fx III published 3rd-party MIDI spec with
AM4-specific extensions.

### Phase 1 — Protocol Layer (complete)
Decoded the editor-write surface via the puppet-the-device approach
(per [DECISIONS.md 2026-04-14](DECISIONS.md)) — no preset-binary RE
required. AM4 + Axe-Fx II XL+ wire layers ship with byte-exact goldens
against real captures.

### Phase 2 — MCP Server MVP (complete)
Wired protocol layer to MCP tools. Tone-from-description works end to
end on AM4 and Axe-Fx II.

### Phase 3 — Preset Intelligence (complete)
Lineage data for amps/drives/cabs/delays/reverbs across Fractal devices.
`lookup_lineage` tool surfaces real-hardware inspiration and Fractal-
authored quotes. Iterative refinement via single-param edits in the
working buffer.

### Phase 4 — Multi-device + Library Management (in progress, v0.1.0)
- Unified 17-tool surface live across registered devices.
- Save-authorization + dirty-buffer + multi-preset overwrite gates
  enforced uniformly (see [`SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md`](SAFE-EDIT-WORKFLOW.md)).
- Setlist authoring shipping for AM4 + Axe-Fx II.
- Workspace monorepo split (2026-05-04) — one package per device.

### Phase 5 — Polish, Distribution, Community Devices (next)
- Signed `.exe` installer (deferred from v0.1.0, see DECISIONS.md 2026-05-03).
- Axe-Fx III community beta → community-captured wire decodes → write
  parity with AM4/II.
- FM9 / FM3 / VP4, Roland/Boss family, more synths — see
  [`MULTI-DEVICE-ROADMAP.md`](MULTI-DEVICE-ROADMAP.md) for the device
  target order and the planned `fractal-midi` / `asm-midi` vendor-
  protocol-package extraction.
